#Open Close Principle

In object-oriented programming, the openâ€“closed principle states "software
entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension,
but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour
to be extended without modifying its source code.

# Specification

Specification pattern allows us to separate the search criteria from the 
object that performs the search. In computer programming, the specification 
pattern is a particular software design pattern, whereby business rules can
be recombined by chaining the business rules together using boolean logic.
